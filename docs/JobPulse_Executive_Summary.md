## The Hidden Problem: Job Visibility Decay

Most staffing agencies focus on *posting* jobs to job boards. But the real challenge isn't posting—it's **staying visible**.

**Job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn penalize stale listings.** Jobs that haven't been updated get pushed down in search results, buried under newer postings. A job posted 30 days ago might as well not exist—candidates simply never see it.

The industry spends millions on job board subscriptions while their postings slowly become invisible.

**JobPulse™ solves job visibility decay through intelligent refresh automation.**

---

## The Golden Goose: Perpetual Freshness

JobPulse™ doesn't just automate posting—it **keeps jobs appearing fresh and new** across all job boards, indefinitely.
