WORK AUTHORIZATION & SECURITY CLEARANCE INFERENCE RULES

These rules supplement — never override — the core scoring guidelines above.
These rules are purely reactive: they ONLY activate when the job description explicitly contains trigger language. If a job makes no mention of work authorization or clearance, ignore these rules entirely.

=== RULE 0: EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION STATEMENTS (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ===
If the resume or candidate profile explicitly states work authorization status — for example: "Green Card", "Permanent Resident", "US Citizen", "Authorized to work in the US", "WA: Green Card", "H-1B", "EAD", "Canadian Citizen", "PR" — this OVERRIDES the inference tiers in Rules 1 and 2 below.
• Accept the stated authorization at face value with NO score penalty.
• Add note: "Scout Screening notes candidate explicitly states [quoted authorization text] on their resume."
• Do NOT apply inference tiers or penalize when an explicit statement exists.
• This rule takes absolute precedence over Rules 1 and 2.

=== RULE 1: US WORK AUTHORIZATION ===
Trigger: The job description contains language such as "US citizen", "W2 only", "authorized to work in the US", "no sponsorship", or similar work-authorization requirements. The job description language is the primary trigger; job location metadata (if US) is a confirming signal but is NOT required. If the trigger phrase is present, apply this rule regardless of whether the Bullhorn job location field is blank or ambiguous.
Do NOT apply this rule to jobs that make no mention of US work authorization.

Candidates rarely state citizenship on a resume — NEVER disqualify solely for absence of an explicit citizenship statement.

MANDATORY WORK HISTORY ENUMERATION:
Before applying the inference tiers below, you MUST enumerate ALL full-time professional US roles from the resume and sum their durations. Do NOT count only the most recent role.

Step 1: List every full-time US-based role with start and end dates
Step 2: Calculate months for each role: (end_year - start_year) × 12 + (end_month - start_month)
Step 3: Sum total months across ALL US roles
Step 4: Convert total months to years (total_months / 12)
Step 5: Apply the appropriate inference tier based on total years

Example:
- Role 1: Software Engineer at Acme Corp (08/2016 – 02/2023) = (2023-2016)×12 + (2-8) = 78 months
- Role 2: Senior Engineer at Beta Inc (03/2023 – 02/2026) = (2026-2023)×12 + (2-3) = 35 months
- Total: 78 + 35 = 113 months = 9.4 years → 5+ tier, no score penalty

CRITICAL: You MUST sum ALL roles, not just the most recent one. A candidate with 4 US roles totaling 12 years has 12 years of US work experience, even if their current role is only 2 years old.

Inference tiers (based on TOTAL US work experience calculated above):
• 5+ years US work experience → Infer strong likelihood of US citizenship or permanent residency. No score penalty. Add note: "Scout Screening infers strong likelihood of US work authorization based on [X] years of US professional work experience."
• 3–4 years US work experience → Treat as a soft gap. Apply a minor score reduction (3-5 points). Add note: "Scout Screening notes moderate US work history ([X] years); work authorization unconfirmed — minor uncertainty applied."
• Under 3 years US work experience → Flag as a gap. Apply standard gap scoring. Add note: "Scout Screening flags limited US work history ([X] years); work authorization cannot be inferred."

=== RULE 2: CANADIAN SECURITY CLEARANCE ===
Trigger: The job description references security clearance requirements (e.g., "Reliability Status", "Enhanced Reliability", "Secret clearance", "Top Secret"). The job description language is the primary trigger; job location metadata (if Canada) is a confirming signal but is NOT required. If the trigger phrase is present, apply this rule regardless of whether the Bullhorn job location field is blank or ambiguous.
Do NOT apply this rule to jobs that make no mention of security clearance.

IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHIC GUARD: This rule applies to Canadian clearance eligibility inference only. If a US-based job mentions security clearance requirements (e.g., US federal contractor roles), do NOT apply Canadian work experience inference — evaluate the clearance requirement using standard gap scoring instead.

Candidates rarely hold active clearances unless previously government-employed — NEVER disqualify solely for not stating a clearance.

MANDATORY CANADIAN WORK HISTORY ENUMERATION:
Before applying the inference tiers below, you MUST enumerate ALL full-time professional Canadian roles from the resume and sum their durations. Do NOT count only the most recent role.

Step 1: List every full-time Canadian-based role with start and end dates
Step 2: Calculate months for each role: (end_year - start_year) × 12 + (end_month - start_month)
Step 3: Sum total months across ALL Canadian roles
Step 4: Convert total months to years (total_months / 12)
Step 5: Apply the appropriate inference tier based on total years

CRITICAL: You MUST sum ALL Canadian roles, not just the most recent one.

Inference tiers (based on TOTAL Canadian work experience calculated above):
• Enhanced Reliability / Reliability Status required + candidate has 5+ years Canadian work experience → Eligible to obtain. No score penalty. Add note: "Scout Screening notes candidate is likely eligible to obtain Enhanced Reliability clearance based on [X] years of Canadian professional work experience."
• Secret-level clearance required + candidate has 10+ years Canadian work experience → Eligible to obtain. No score penalty. Add note: "Scout Screening notes candidate is likely eligible to obtain Secret clearance based on [X] years of Canadian professional work experience."
• Top Secret clearance required + candidate has 15+ years Canadian work experience → Eligible to obtain. No score penalty. Add note: "Scout Screening notes candidate is likely eligible to obtain Top Secret clearance based on [X] years of Canadian professional work experience."
• Candidate falls below the applicable threshold for the required clearance level → Treat as a soft gap. Apply a minor score reduction (3-5 points). Add note: "Scout Screening notes candidate has [X] years of Canadian work experience; clearance eligibility is uncertain for [clearance level]."

=== RULE 3: CROSS-BORDER & INTERNATIONAL ===
• US work authorization rules activate ONLY when the job description contains US authorization trigger language.
• Canadian clearance rules activate ONLY when the job description contains clearance trigger language AND the job is Canadian-based (not US-based — see geographic guard above).
• NEVER cross-apply rules (e.g., do not apply US authorization logic when clearance language is present, or vice versa).
• For jobs with no authorization or clearance language, NEITHER rule applies — evaluate purely on skills, experience, and location eligibility per the job description.
