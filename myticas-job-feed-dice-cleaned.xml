    &lt;br /&gt; A leading provider of real-time video processing technology is seeking a &lt;strong&gt;Senior FPGA Developer&lt;/strong&gt; to join its core signal processing team. This group is responsible for developing high-performance media transport and processing systems used by global clients in live production, broadcast, and media environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to work on cutting-edge, high-bandwidth systems built on advanced FPGA platforms—delivering critical real-time features that enable professional-grade media production. You’ll be surrounded by a highly experienced team that values innovation, collaboration, and practical problem solving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Design and implement RTL for advanced real-time media systems with interfaces including memory, PCIe, and hardware-accelerated video processing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Develop transport protocol implementations (e.g., SDI, SMPTE 2110) within FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collaborate on system architecture—reviewing schematics, optimizing clocking, thermal considerations, and FPGA resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perform full IO ring designs for leading FPGA families (e.g., Arria10, Stratix-10, Ultrascale+, Agilex).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Define and document high-level system requirements; support component selection and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create simulation testbenches (Verilog/SystemVerilog); perform functional verification and debugging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collaborate cross-functionally with software, hardware, and manufacturing teams through the full product lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mentor peers and support technical knowledge sharing within the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;5+ years of hands-on FPGA design experience, preferably with exposure to video or audio systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strong Verilog/SystemVerilog and scripting skills (TCL).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience with Intel and/or Xilinx FPGAs and their respective toolchains (Quartus, Vivado).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Familiarity with high-speed serial interfaces, DDR3/4, HBM, PLLs, and signal integrity principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excellent debugging and validation skills; proficiency with lab tools (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, WFMs, etc.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Background in embedded systems (Linux, bash, C/C++) considered a plus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding of media production workflows and digital video standards (SMPTE, HDR, SDI) is advantageous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </description>
