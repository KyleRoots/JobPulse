All right after a bit of monitoring noticed a few recommended candidates come through which is great to see. Of course just given the lower threshold. However I did want to just note and get a bit more of an understanding of the following:
- My first question is: When that strictness toggle is set to whether it's closer or further away from 100% what does that actually affect from the AI perspective? Is it the actual skills required for the position meaning that the AI lets more of the mandatories pass or how does that work? Just filming in briefly.
- I'm providing an example of some screenshots attached but there was one candidate that came in who was recommended for more than one position. Very good candidate by the way from a skills perspective. So that's really nice to see. However the candidate was located in a different country than what the original job was looking for. Although we nailed it with the skills perspective, I do believe we have to just quickly visit back ensure that if the job is mentioned within the specific fields of the job record that it is either a hybrid or on-site role. Our AI needs to recognize the value that's inputted into the city and state fields of that particular job record and use that to cross-reference with the quality of the profiles to determine a fit. For instance that candidate would be an absolute no-brainer if they were located in the city or even province/state level for that particular role. But the fact that they were in a different country altogether disqualifies them right away.
- Remote positions is a bit of a different angle because most of the time the candidate needs to be within the country that the role is tied to but not necessarily the city, state, or province level.
So let's discuss how we can potentially bake this into the AI or assist the AI in determining quality based on not just the skill sets but the location as well of the individual as it references to whatever the requirement is of the role. I'm not sure how we're going to interpret that from the back-end or even in the UI side when AI interprets the job requirements but I just wanted to throw that out there and see what you thought about it first.
