Great, thanks for clarifying. This ties in well with my upcoming points. I noticed some UI adjustments we can make on the '/scout-screening' page:
- The high-level macro metrics aren’t neatly 'boxed in' like they are in Scout Inbound (though, from the screenshots, you can see some overlap between the 'Applicants Processed' and 'Duplicate Applicants' text and the icons on those boxes. Let's tidy that up if possible).
- The 'pill-type' selector at the top right should highlight based on whichever module the user is on. Currently, it does so in the screening module but not in the inbound one.
- The table within the screening module also needs cleanup. It currently floats around, making it look messy and disorganized. The inbound module has this right, so let's fix that.
- When clicking on those macro-level metrics to filter the table, nothing appears to happen. This might be because no candidates are recommended. For example, if the user clicks on 'qualified matches,' 'pending review,' or any with zero values, it should still filter the table, just without displaying results if that makes sense.
- The table display itself is quite compact and hard to interpret. It needs to be made more user-friendly and aligned with the module’s branding.
- In the 'Screened Candidates' table, let's add pagination after the first ten results, as continuous scrolling can be a bit overwhelming to reach the next section of job level settings.
- The job level settings also need cleaning up in a clear, tabular format, making it easier for users to interpret.
- Instead of a box for 'custom override,' let's make the button hyperlinked. On clicking it, the user should see a pop-out embedded screen where they can set custom rules and thresholds, then save. This allows more space for things like the job title and AI-interpreted requirements.
- The arrow to expand or contract job details doesn’t seem to work when clicked.
Overall, the page looks great but definitely needs that clean rebranding touch, similar to the other modules.
