Thank you for the detailed information—your setup and troubleshooting steps are excellent and thorough. Based on what you've shared, here’s a summary and some next steps:

### What’s Confirmed Working
- **Subdomain:** parse.lyntrix.ai (not root)
- **MX Record:** Only mx.sendgrid.net, priority 10, verified externally
- **Sending To:** test@parse.lyntrix.ai, jobs@parse.lyntrix.ai (no reserved words)
- **Webhook URL:** https://jobpulse.lyntrix.ai/api/email/inbound, returns 200 OK
- **Testing:** Sent from Gmail and Office 365, no bounces, but no activity in Parse Webhook Stats

### Key Points from Documentation & Best Practices
- The MX record must be the only MX for the subdomain and must be fully propagated.
- The subdomain must be added and active in the SendGrid Inbound Parse settings, and the root domain must be authenticated in SendGrid.
- The subdomain-domain combination must be unique in your SendGrid account.
- Only emails sent to addresses at the subdomain (e.g., anything@parse.lyntrix.ai) will be processed.
- The webhook must not redirect and must return a 2xx status.

### Additional Checks
1. **Domain Authentication:**  
   - Is lyntrix.ai authenticated in your SendGrid account? Only authenticated domains can be used for Inbound Parse.
2. **Parse Entry in SendGrid:**  
   - In your SendGrid dashboard, under Settings > Inbound Parse, is there an entry for subdomain: parse, domain: lyntrix.ai, and the correct webhook URL?
3. **No CNAME Loops:**  
   - If you use the same subdomain as your authenticated domain’s return path, Automatic Security must be disabled to avoid CNAME>MX loops.
4. **Propagation:**  
   - While MXToolbox shows the record, some ISPs may cache DNS for up to 24–48 hours. If possible, try sending from a mobile network or a different ISP to rule out local DNS caching.

### Next Steps
- If all the above are confirmed and you still see zero activity in the Parse Webhook Stats, this does suggest a possible activation or provisioning issue on SendGrid’s side.
- As a final test, you can try pointing your webhook to a service like webhook.site to confirm if any traffic is being received at all. If nothing appears there, it further confirms the issue is before the webhook stage.

Would you like me to connect you with a Twilio Support agent to investigate potential activation or provisioning issues with your Inbound Parse setup for parse.lyntrix.ai? This will help ensure there are no backend issues preventing email processing on your account. Let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any other details to add!
