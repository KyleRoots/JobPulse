JobPulse™ Executive Summary
Intelligent Job Feed Automation Platform
Prepared For: Investors & Stakeholders
Date: January 2026
Company: [Entity Name]

The Opportunity
The staffing and recruitment industry faces a critical challenge: job posting management. Agencies lose 40+ hours monthly managing job feeds and posts, experience 15-20% error rates in job identifiers, and suffer 24-48 hour delays in job board updates.

JobPulse™ eliminates these inefficiencies through intelligent automation.

What is JobPulse™?
JobPulse™ is an enterprise-grade job feed automation platform that connects Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to job board distribution networks. It automates the entire job posting lifecycle—from data extraction to classification to distribution—while ensuring data integrity and real-time synchronization.
