Hi Kyle,

The redirect URI's are updated to include the following:

https://myticas.com/bullhorn_oauth_callback.php
https://49cc4d39-c8af-4fa8-8edf-ea2819b0c88a-00-1b6n9tc9un0ln.janeway.replit.dev/bullhorn/oauth/callback
https://workspace.kyleroots00.replit.app/bullhorn/oauth/callback

I'll therefore be closing this case. Have a great week!

Thank you for contacting Bullhorn Support!

Hi Kyle,

This is Nathan from Bullhorn Support.

We can certainly whitelist multiple redirect URI's for you.

Could you provide me with the Client ID and last 4 characters of your secret, please?
Alternatively, I can also set up a new API key for you.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you for contacting Bullhorn Support!
