Ok, great. Thanks for clarifying. This connects well with my next points. I noticed some UI adjustments we can make on this '/scout-screening' page:
- The high-level macro metrics are not 'boxed in' as neatly as they are in Scout Inbound. From the screenshots, you can see some overlap between the text 'Applicants Processed' and 'Duplicate Applicants' with the icons on those box cards. Let's clean that up if possible.
- The 'pill-type' selector at the top right should highlight based on the module the user is in. Currently, it does this when you're on the screening module but not on the inbound one.
- The table within the screening module needs to be cleaned up. As it stands, it looks messy and unorganised, floating around. The inbound module has this set up well, so let's aim for that.
- When clicking on those macro-level metrics to filter the table, nothing seems to happen regarding the information displayed. Likely because no candidates are recommended. For example, if the user clicks on 'qualified matches', 'pending review', or any with zero values, it should still filter the table, even if it shows no results.
- I find the display table very compact and difficult to interpret. It needs to be simplified for a more user-friendly experience and aligned with the branding of that module.
- In the 'Screened Candidates' table, let's add pagination after about ten results. Continuous scrolling can make it hard to reach the next section of the job level settings.
- The job level settings tab also needs to be cleaned up. The format is missing clarity and could be simplified for easier user interpretation. For example, instead of a box for 'custom override,' make the button hyperlinked. When the user clicks this, they should see a popup where they can set custom rules and thresholds, then save. This allows more room for details like job title and AI-interpreted requirements.
- The arrow to expand or collapse the job details doesn’t seem to work when clicked.
Overall, it looks great but definitely needs that clean rebranding touch like the other modules.
