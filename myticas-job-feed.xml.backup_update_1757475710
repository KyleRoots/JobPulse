    <description><![CDATA[ <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;">We’re currently seeking a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer who thrives at the intersection of data science, engineering, and operations. This role is ideal for someone who has not only mastered the craft of building and scaling ML solutions, but also knows how to put them into production, and keep them running smoothly.</span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"><strong>What You’ll Be Doing:</strong></span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;">The role is a mix of MLOps, platform development, and hands-on model engineering. You’ll be responsible for designing automated workflows that take ML models from development to deployment with minimal friction. This includes developing robust CI/CD pipelines (preferably using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions) and managing model lifecycle tasks such as versioning, monitoring, and retraining.</span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;">A large portion of your time will be spent working within Databricks—developing feature pipelines, optimizing model workflows, and integrating ML components with existing SaaS systems.
