    <description><![CDATA[&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;We’re currently seeking a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer who thrives at the intersection of data science, engineering, and operations. This role is ideal for someone who has not only mastered the craft of building and scaling ML solutions, but also knows how to put them into production, and keep them running smoothly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Be Doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;The role is a mix of MLOps, platform development, and hands-on model engineering. You’ll be responsible for designing automated workflows that take ML models from development to deployment with minimal friction. This includes developing robust CI/CD pipelines (preferably using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions) and managing model lifecycle tasks such as versioning, monitoring, and retraining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;A large portion of your time will be spent working within Databricks—developing feature pipelines, optimizing model workflows, and integrating ML components with existing SaaS systems. You’ll also help migrate and scale models within an environment already hosting over 100 ML models, with another 25+ targeted for transition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;On the application side, you’ll work closely with data scientists to productionalize machine learning prototypes. You’ll select appropriate algorithms, build scalable ML systems using Python-based frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and help tune and evaluate performance over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideal Candidate Brings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;5+ years of experience in software, data, or DevOps engineering roles—with at least 3 of those focused on MLOps or ML engineering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Expertise in Python, and confidence working with key ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Hands-on experience working in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem—particularly Azure ML, AKS, and Azure DevOps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Deep familiarity with Databricks (including Delta Lake, MLflow, and Apache Spark) is non-negotiable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;An understanding of infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform), version control, and CI/CD practices in ML workflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Strong communication skills and the ability to work cross-functionally across technical and business teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;You must be located in Canada and able to work with Canadian teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Certifications from Databricks or Microsoft (e.g., Azure Solution Architect).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Experience working with LLM libraries or frameworks like transformers, trl, or deepspeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;Prior involvement in ML model migration projects or SaaS ML platform integration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;li style="margin: 0.0cm;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;A consulting background or client-facing role where clear communication and stakeholder management were key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;Myticas Consulting is seeking a highly experienced Machine Learning Engineer to join a fast-paced, client-facing environment focused on delivering scalable ML solutions. This role is hands-on and deeply technical, involving the modernization and migration of mature ML models within a complex production ecosystem. You’ll be leading architectural efforts, implementing robust MLOps practices, and supporting the integration of ML applications into SaaS platforms. Strong communication skills are essential, as the position requires regular collaboration with stakeholders and mentoring of junior team members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"&gt;This opportunity is open exclusively to candidates located in Canada with a solid background in production-grade ML engineering—not recent graduates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Aptos , sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"&gt;Role/Responsibilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
