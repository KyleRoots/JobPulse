Subject: API Authentication Issues - Account: qts.api (Quality Temporary Services Inc.)

Dear Bullhorn Support Team,

We are experiencing authentication failures with our API integration account and need your assistance to resolve this issue.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Username: qts.api
- Account Type: Rest API User
- Private Label: Quality Temporary Services Inc.
- Client ID: cc648565-f*** (truncated for security)

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Our automated job feed integration has been failing authentication since approximately September 1, 2025. We recently reset the password for the qts.api account to 'Myticas01!' through the Bullhorn interface, but authentication continues to fail.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
1. OAuth Endpoint: https://auth.bullhornstaffing.com/oauth/authorize
2. Response Status: 200 (returns login page instead of 302 redirect)
3. Error Message: "Invalid credentials"
4. Additional Indicators: Response HTML suggests the account may be disabled

AUTHENTICATION FLOW ATTEMPTED:
- GET /rest-services/loginInfo (succeeds)
- POST /oauth/authorize with credentials (fails with "Invalid credentials")
- Using redirect URI: https://job-feed-refresh.replit.app/bullhorn/oauth/callback

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS TAKEN:
1. Verified Client ID and Client Secret are correct
2. Reset password through Bullhorn UI to 'Myticas01!'
3. Confirmed account shows as "Enabled" and "Unlocked" in the interface
4. Waited for password change to propagate (over 2 hours)
5. Verified OAuth redirect URI is whitelisted

QUESTIONS:
1. Are there any API-specific settings that need to be enabled for the qts.api account?
2. Is there a password policy that might be rejecting 'Myticas01!' for API accounts?
3. Are there IP restrictions or additional security settings affecting API authentication?
4. Is the account properly configured for OAuth 2.0 authentication?
5. Are there any known issues with the authentication servers?

BUSINESS IMPACT:
This integration is critical for our job posting automation system. Without it:
- Job listings are not synchronizing between Bullhorn and our public job feed
- Reference numbers cannot be properly maintained
- Real-time job updates are not being processed

We would appreciate urgent assistance in resolving this authentication issue. Please let us know if you need any additional information or if there are specific logs we should provide.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Quality Temporary Services Inc.
