- Job description content
- Industry context
- Role responsibilities

The AI system selects the most appropriate category from these predefined lists to ensure consistency with LinkedIn's standard taxonomy.

## Notes

- **Job Functions**: Must match one of the 28 predefined categories
- **Industries**: Must match one of the 20 predefined categories
- **Seniority Levels**: Must match one of the 5 predefined levels
- **Fallback Logic**: If AI classification fails, the system defaults to keyword-based classification
- **Update Policy**: This list should only be updated when LinkedIn officially changes their taxonomy
